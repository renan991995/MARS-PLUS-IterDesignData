# Iterative molesular design from MARS+

[MARS+ program](https://github.com/renan991995/MARS-PLUS) has been used to demonstrate a 5-round iterative molecular design starting with methane.

The raw data regarding to this task can be found within this repository, including:

* **Log file for operations** : marslog

* **Unique species in each round** : mol-[1-5]gen.txt files

* **Statistics of operations** : statistics.txt

* **Molecular data structure (MDS) for the generated molecules** : \*.enc files
